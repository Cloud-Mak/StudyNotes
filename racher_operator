racher

Racher (Server)
 Consist of auth proxy, Rachner API server, (downstream) clsuter controller & etcd.
 for prodution its reccomended to intsall rancher in RKE cluster.

 The authentication proxy forwards all Kubernetes API calls to downstream clusters. It integrates with authentication services like local authentication, Active Directory, and GitHub. On every Kubernetes API call, the authentication proxy authenticates the caller and sets the proper Kubernetes impersonation headers before forwarding the call to Kubernetes masters.

 Cluster agent (or node agent in case of cluster agents goes down) Communicates between the cluster and Rancher server (through a tunnel to the cluster controller) about events, stats, node info, and health.

 If the cluster agent (also called cattle-cluster-agent) is not available, one of the node agents creates a tunnel to the cluster controller to communicate with Rancher.
 The cattle-node-agent is deployed using a DaemonSet resource to make sure it runs on every node in a Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster

 An authorized cluster endpoint allows users to connect to the Kubernetes API server of a downstream cluster without having to route their requests through the Rancher authentication proxy. Endpoint is available with rancher RKE clusters only. not with imported cluster or hosted cluster.

RKE
 Its both K8 upstream distribution and installer.
 Important files to backup after RKE setup - cluster.rkestate & kube_config_cluster.yml. 1st contains certificate and credential information for accessing the cluster.

 Backups
  RKE defaults to making a snapshot every six hours and holding snapshots for one day.
  "rke etcd snapshot-save" will save snaps to /opt/rke/etcd-snapshots (mount NFS volume to move data offhost or you can config backup to S3)
