^_^ In detailed - What happens when you launch new container
 
 When you type docker run, the Docker CLI, the client converts then into proper API payloads & POSTS then to corret API ENDpoint.
 API endpoint is implemented into deamon, thus command to create container is reveived by deamon. Deamon then calls containerD (via CRUD-style API over gRPC).
 containerD looks for image locally. If not, then pull request for image is genrated from registry (mostly dockerhub.com)
